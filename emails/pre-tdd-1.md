Hi everyone,

Tidyverse Developer Day is coming up soon on Friday, September 19! We'll meet at the ___ [TO DO: Need to update location]. We'll kick off the program at 9am, but we recommend that you come a little earlier (>=8:30am) in order to setup and grab some coffee. We'll provide coffee, snacks, and lunch, but you might want to get breakfast before you arrive. The day will wrap up with a social hour at 4pm. [TO DO: Confirm schedule]

There are three things we recommend you do before the day:

* Fill out this (very short) survey so we can learn more about your goals and current skills: <https://forms.gle/6n5vD1zwZQpu2mQk7>. [TO DO: Update survey link]

* Check that you're ready to work on an R package with Git and GitHub by following the steps at <https://github.com/tidyverse/tidy-dev-day?tab=readme-ov-file#0-get-ready>. 

* If you haven't made a pull request (PR) before, please make a practice PR by following the instructions at <https://github.com/tidyverse/tidy-dev-day/tree/main/practice-pr>.

If you run into any problems, we are hosting an (optional) hour-long virtual "office hour" prior to the event. Here you can get help with your Git workflow so that you can stroll into TDD confident that your R, Positron or RStudio, Git, and GitHub are set up in the best way possible. We will also answer any questions you might have about the event. We anticipate that the office hour would be most helpful for those who are new to package development and collaboration on GitHub, but all are welcome to attend regardless of prior experience. The office hour will be on Friday, September 5 - 08:00 PST / 11:00 EST / 16:00 BST. You can join at <https://positpbc.zoom.us/j/97096762863?jst=2> anytime during the hour.

Looking forward to seeing you all soon!
