Welcome to tidyverse developer day! To help get to know each other, we'll start the day off with a short game. It will go like this:

-   Mingle and find people who match the descriptions on your card.

-   When you find a match, write the person's name in the corresponding square. (Only one square per person!)

-   The goal is to fill as many squares as possible. Once you've filled in the whole card, find Simon to congregate for a group photo!
